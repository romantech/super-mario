# Simple Super Mario Runner Game

This is a Mario Runner game implemented in vanilla JavaScript without using canvas. When the game starts, Mario automatically runs forward, and obstacles are randomly generated ahead. These obstacles can be avoided by jumping, which is done by pressing space (on PC) or touching (on Mobile). Every time you avoid an obstacle, the Score increases by 1 point. 

Additionally, a gravity effect has been implemented to make Mario's jumps look more natural.
