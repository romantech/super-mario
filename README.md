# Simple Super Mario Runner Game

This is a Super Mario runner game implemented with vanilla JavaScript without using canvas. 
Once the game starts, Mario automatically moves forward. Obstacles are randomly generated in front of him, and the player can press space (to jump) to avoid these obstacles. For each obstacle successfully avoided, the score increases by one point. It's a simple yet engaging game.
